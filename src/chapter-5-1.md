Emotional intelligence is the ability to understand and manage one's emotions and those of others. It is a crucial component of adaptive decision-making, as it allows individuals to remain calm under pressure, communicate effectively, and collaborate with others. By developing emotional intelligence skills, individuals can make better decisions, build stronger relationships, and improve their overall performance.
